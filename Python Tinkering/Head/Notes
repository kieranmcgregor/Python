*** Cerebra ***
Born    Upon beginning of program (may change later)
Life    Manage Neurons
Death   Upon death of all Neurons

*** Neurons ***
Born    When all Neurons reach continue_propagation_certainty and when neuronal
        activity levels reach a certain threshold
Life    -Manage birth, life and death of PreDendrites and Dendrites
        -Manage inputs received from Dendrites
        -Produces PreDendrites and Dendrites
        -Propagates signal to Dendrites
Death   When Neuron reaches rest certainty

*** PreDendrite ***
Born    When Neurons and Nerves for together
Life    -Track occurrences of Neuron-Nerve combinations
        -Decays by 1 count over time
        -Negative feedback decreases count by 3
Death   -When count reaches 0
        -When count reaches threshold for Dendrite creation
        -When input Neuron or output Neuron reaches rest certainty or Nerve
        dies

*** Dendrite ***
Born    When Neuron is created or PreDendrite reaches threshold
Life    Propagate signals from Neuron to Neuron and Neuron to Nerve
Death   When Dendrite has zero connections

*** Nerve ***
Born    When Neuron is born
Life    Produce outputs
Death   When attached Dendrite reaches stop_propagation_certainty
